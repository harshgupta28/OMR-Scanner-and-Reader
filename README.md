Problem Statement -

  To avoid in-person contact altogether, some universities have opted to conduct the majority of their exams online. Online exams are still a new phenomenon at higher education     institutions, so thereâ€™s a lot to learn regarding the widespread implementation of these new Objective type exam processes. A major challenge is to check each and every
  submission manually.
                      Develop software that can be used to read as well as check the OMR answer sheets. The software should compare the answers marked by the students with the
  answer key and provide the total marks at the end. This is a great tool for exams that have MCQ type or objective type questions.
